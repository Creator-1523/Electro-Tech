 # Light Dependent Resistor(LDR)
 ## What is Light Dependent Resistor?
 An electronic component like LDR or light-dependent resistor is responsive to light. Once light rays drop on it, then immediately the resistance will be changed. The resistance values of an LDR may change over several orders of magnitude. The resistance value will be dropped when the light level increases.


These resistors are often used in many circuits where it is required to sense the presence of light. These resistors have a variety of functions and resistance. For instance, when the LDR is in darkness, then it can be used to turn ON a light or to turn OFF a light when it is in the light. A typical light dependent resistor has a resistance in the darkness of 1MOhm, and in the brightness a resistance of a couple of KOhm

# Solar Panels

Solar panels work by absorbing sunlight with photovoltaic cells, generating direct current (DC) energy and then converting it to usable alternating current (AC) energy with the help of inverter technology. AC energy then flows through the home’s electrical panel or any appliances  and is distributed accordingly. 

## Working of Solar Panels:

1. Solar panels absorb the sun’s energy and convert it to DC electricity
2. The solar inverter converts DC electricity from your solar modules to AC electricity, which is used by most appliances
3. Electricity flows through your home, powering electronic devices
4. Excess electricity produced by solar panels is fed to the electric grid

## How does grid connection work with solar panels?

Though electricity generation with solar panels may make sense to most people, there’s still a lot of general confusion about how the grid factors into the home solar process. Any home that is connected to the electrical grid will have something called a utility meter that your energy provider uses to measure and supply power to your home. When you install solar panels on your roof or on a ground mount on your property, they are eventually connected to your home’s utility meter. The production of your solar system can actually be accessed and measured by this meter.

## How do solar panels work to generate electricity?

A standard solar panel (also known as a solar module) consists of a layer of silicon cells, a metal frame, a glass casing, and various wiring to allow current to flow from the silicon cells. Silicon (atomic #14 on the periodic table) is a nonmetal with conductive properties that allow it to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity. When light interacts with a silicon cell, it causes electrons to be set into motion, which initiates a flow of electric current. This is known as the “photovoltaic effect,” and it describes the general functionality of solar panel technology.


The general photovoltaic process, as described above, works through the following steps:
The silicon photovoltaic solar cell absorbs solar radiation
When the sun’s rays interact with the silicon cell, electrons begin to move, creating a flow of electric current
Wires capture and feed this direct current (DC) electricity to a solar inverter to be converted to alternating current (AC) electricity
